Link to my notion page 'STANDBY' containing notes on e.g. the facebook experiment study design, formulated research questions, data dictionary explaning variables in the json files and the 'desired_data_structure.xlsl'  : https://www.notion.so/STANDBY-e7809ca5ae104139a002c415fdfbdcc8?pvs=4 

To-Do:

analysis

- do multilevel modelling in R
    - ~~can intervention by predicted by sentiment (accounting for nestedness)~~ = NO
    - Try other models: can sentiment of comments be predicted by e.g. municipality, offentlig/privat, n_reactions etc.
    - see ‘Research question(s)’ page for inspiration
- Machine learning
    - Can a classifier learn to predict the sentiment of a comment based on some predictors (e.g. kommune, n_likes, n_comments, etc.)
